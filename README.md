# RoboBuddies
A fun mini-project that taught me a great deal of fundamentals of React such as components design and use of state. I also used two API's for getting user information (jsonPlaceholder) and random robot images (robohash).

# To run the project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`# robobuddies
